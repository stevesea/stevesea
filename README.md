I'm a software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. My background is mostly development in a handful of industries -- flight simulation, medical/acedemic publishing, flash storage, and blockchain. 

I've always been interested in reducing developer toil and helping myself and coworkers work more efficiently. The last few years my focus has been platform engineering / SRE / DevOps work, and I currently work at an online retailer assisting with app modernization and cloud adoption (Terraform, CICD, Observability, etc). 

I like to cook, garden, read sci-fi and fantasy, and play TTRPGs.
