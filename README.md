I'm a software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. My background is mostly development in a handful of industries -- flight simulation, medical/acedemic publishing, flash storage, and some blockchain work. 

I've always been interested in reducing developer toil and helping myself and coworkers work more efficiently. The last few years my focus has been platform engineering / SRE / DevOps work, and I currently work at a mid-size retailer assisting with app modernization and cloud adoption (Terraform, CICD, Observability, etc). 

In my spare time, I like to cook, garden, read sci-fi and fantasy, and play TTRPGs.
